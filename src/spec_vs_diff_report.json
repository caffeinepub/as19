  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all PIN-based folder access control requirements (REQ-13 through REQ-20). Backend storage, hashing, verification endpoint with rate limiting, and frontend PIN setup, verification, change, and reset flows are all implemented with comprehensive English and Hindi translations. Session-based authentication is properly integrated across all folder pages (Photos, Videos, Documents, Memories) with PIN status indicators in the navigation.",
